# **Customer Rating System**  
A Python-based project to simulate, store, and analyze customer ratings. This system demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and data manipulation techniques using Python and pandas. It is designed to generate synthetic customer data, save it in a structured format (CSV), and analyze it for insights such as identifying customers with high ratings.

## **1. Overview**
The **Customer Rating System** aims to automate the process of generating random customer data, storing it, and analyzing it to identify high-value customers. The project is ideal for demonstrating how Python can be used for tasks like random data generation, file handling, and simple data analysis.

This project showcases:  
- The use of Pythonâ€™s `random` and `string` libraries for generating synthetic data.  
- Effective storage of data using pandas DataFrames and CSV files.  
- An OOP-based design for managing customer information and processing data.

## **2. Features**
- **Random Data Generation**:
  - Generates realistic customer information such as:
    - Customer ID (4-digit unique number).
    - Name (randomly generated alphabetic string).
    - Age (between 18 and 65).
    - Mobile Number (10-digit number).
    - Rating (floating-point value between 1 and 5).
- **CSV File Storage**:
  - Stores the generated data into a CSV file for persistence.
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Filters and identifies customers with ratings greater than or equal to 3.5.
  - Displays the high-rated customers in a readable format.

---

## **3. Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`: For handling data storage and analysis.  
  - `random` and `string`: For generating synthetic data.  
- **File Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) for structured data storage.

## **8. Future Enhancements**
This project can be extended with additional features:
1. **Real-Time Data Collection**: Integrate APIs to fetch real customer feedback dynamically.  
2. **Data Visualization**: Use tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize customer ratings.  
3. **Machine Learning**: Predict customer satisfaction levels based on historical data.  
4. **Web Integration**: Create a web interface to upload CSV files and display results.
